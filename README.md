# Project Name
> BoomBikes Linear Regression.


## Table of Contents
* This is EDA and Linear Model building project where we analyse various parameters that affect demand of bikes. Mostly process followed are data understanding ,cleaning manipulation,analysis,model building,model validation and presentation
* Python
* Numpy, Pandas,seaborn,sklearn,statsmodels and matplotlib are fantastic libraries that speed up EDA.
* Upgrad staff and peers



## General Information
- This is EDA and Linear Model building project where we analyse various parameters that affect demand of bikes.
- To understand model building using Linear regression
- To understand paramaters that affect demand of bikes and how they help in building model.
- Linear regression for model building and validation.



## Conclusions
- Demand is dependent on temperature
- Demand decreases slightly with windspeed.
- Demand is dependent on time of year

## Technologies Used
- Python - version 3
- pandas - version 2.0.3
- numpy - version 1.25.2
- seaborn - version 0.12.2
- sklearn - version 1.1
- statsmodels - version 0.14.0
- matplotlib - version 3.7.2
